### CODE BOOK

Here is a list and description of variables used withing the SubjectActivitiesAverages.txt file.  Note that the underlying source of these data are from the Humand Activities Recognition Using Smartphone Dataset located at the following URL:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This new data set specifically targets only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement out of the original test and train datasets.  The intention of the new data set is to provide the mean for each subject and activity for every targeted variable combination.  For a detailed explaination of the underlying variables, please see the source information at the URL above.

The SubjectActivitiesAverages.txt contains 180 obeservations of 87 veriables.

This data set contains the following fields:  (Note that the first field "subject_activity" is a combination of the participating subject and the activity code.  These codes are include: 1 WALKING, 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS,3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4 SITTING, 5 STANDING, 6 LAYING)
